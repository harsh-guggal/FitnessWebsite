        <h1>PERSONAL TRAINING IN MILTON KEYNES</h1>
        <p>
          We're a private personal training studio in Milton Keynes who help
          busy men & women stop "trying to get in shape", and finally achieve a
          health & body transformation they won’t rebound from…

    <div class="infocontainer">
      <h1>IT'S TIME TO PUT YOURSELF FIRST</h1>

      <p>
        We work with men and women that have let fitness slide down their list
        of priorities, and want to make a change

        <br />
        <br />
        Using our Armoury Transformation Formula, we'll guide you through our
        proven system of creating a healthier, happier and more confident
        version of yourself in the next 6 weeks- without boring workouts, or fad
        diets
        <br />
        <br />

        We believe fitness should enhance your life, rather than take away from
        it- every Armoury Transformation starts with an in-depth look at where
        you currently are, and creates an achievable path to where you want to
        be.
        <br />
        <br />

        Whether that's ditching the mid-afternoon energy slump so you can be
        active with your kids after school, banishing the expanding midsection
        that's making it harder to slide into your work trousers each passing
        year, or finally having the body confidence to buy clothes that show off
        your physique, rather than hide it
        <br />
        <br />

        In just 42 days we'll take you from feeling frustrated with your current
        trajectory, to feeling proud of the positive habits you've built
        <br />
        <br />

      <h1>GETTING RESULTS SINCE 2010</h1>

      <p>
        The Armoury would be nothing without the men and women that have put
        their trust in us over the last 10 years, and working together we've had
        the privilege of seeing some truly tremendous accomplishments. Whether
        that means gaining the confidence to wear a two-piece at the beach after
        having their first child, fitting into the suit they always imagined
        they'd wear for their daughters wedding, or the everyday confidence that
        permeates everything they do, installed through the effort they've put
        in at the studio.

      <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>

      <p>
        Committed to providing effective personal training in Milton Keynes and
        helping you achieve sustainable results, The Armoury Coaching Studio is
        designed to be different. Unlike traditional gyms and
        too-good-to-be-true weight loss plans, we don’t believe in short-term
        fixes. Instead, we’ll help you to set realistic goals - and achieve them

        <br />
        <br />

        If you’re desperate to get back into your favourite clothes that have
        been relegated to the back of the closet, are tired of your work shirts
        beginning to feel the strain around your stomach, and feel sick of
        no-longer having the “get-up-and-go” you felt when you were younger? Our
        mission is to help you get that mojo back, and to feel confident the
        next time you’re on a beach, making a presentation at work, or running
        around with your kids

        <br />
        <br />

        Training & addressing your diet with the correct approach adds to your
        life exponentially, through increasing your energy, decreasing your
        stress, heightening your mood, boosting long-term health, and equipping
        you with confidence in your everyday strength and appearance. Which is
        exactly why we designed The Armoury from the ground up to be the best
        1-2-1 & Small Group Personal Training Studio in Milton Keynes. If you’d
        like to be part of a coaching environment that puts you first? Get in
